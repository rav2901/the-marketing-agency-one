# Refractor code challange
## html changes:
I've changed the title to improve seo.
Fixed first link by adding id search engine optimization
I've added alt atributes to all images.
Modified footer form h2 to h4.
## css changes:
I've replaced .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, and .benefit-cost h3 with h3 on css, because I've noticed all three had the same css styles applied. I've also changed the  h3 margin bottom property from 10px to 50px so the right background looks more like the demo.png
I've replaced the the two h2 in css to onc h2 because I've noticed both had the same css styles applied.
Moved all the content related to the left-side of the page from the bottom of the css file towards the top to make it easier to read.
Some of the css properties were repeating so I've used a selector list (,) to group the html elements together.
